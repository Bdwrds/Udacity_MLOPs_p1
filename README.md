# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project aims to demonstrates the workflow of coding best practices for a standard data science task. This includes best practices on; general workflow, testing, logging, and PEP8 standards. 

## Install Dependencies

Running the below will install all dependencies necessary to run both python scripts.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Running Files

Running the below will test each function from churn_library.py.
During this process it will write log results in the ./logs directory.

```bash
ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
````

Running the below will step through each function of the data science process.
This includes; exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature transformations, model training and saving results. 

```bash
ipython churn_library.py
````
This will generate:
- EDA plots in the ./images/eda/ directory
- training results in the ./images/results/ directory
- models that are saved in the ./models/ directory
- feature importances results in the ./images/results/ directory
